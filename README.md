# Deep Learning aided Polymer Properties Prediction

This project explores the prediction of polymer properties (e.g., Tg, FFV, Tc, Density, Rg) using multiple machine learning methods:
- **Graph Neural Networks (GCN)** for molecular graph representation learning
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** for feature-based prediction
- **XGBoost** for classical machine learning baseline

The project was originally developed for polymer property prediction tasks, aiming to evaluate and compare deep learning and classical ML methods in computational chemistry and material science.
